Precise Cartesian Cube Sorter

This repository contains Arduino code for a precision-driven Cartesian robot designed to classify and sort cubes by color. The robot is equipped with 4 stepper motors for movement control, each powered by a DRV8825 driver, ensuring smooth and precise Cartesian motion. The gripper utilizes a servo, providing enhanced accuracy for handling each cube during sorting.

Features:

- Color Detection: Uses color sensors to identify the color of each cube.

- Cartesian Motion Control: Controlled by 4 stepper motors and DRV8825 drivers for precise positioning within a Cartesian coordinate system.

- Precision Gripper: A servo motor-powered gripper ensures careful handling of each cube.

- Efficient Sorting Algorithm: Optimizes cube placement based on detected color.

- Arduino Controlled: Built with Arduino for ease of programming and customization.

Getting Started:
Clone this repository and upload the code to your Arduino to bring your color-sorting robot to life! Perfect for projects requiring accuracy in sorting and handling tasks.
